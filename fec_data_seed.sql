This completely remodeled, octagon treehouse is just 15 minutes from most attractions in Colorado Springs and 5 minutes from the famous Pikes Peak Highway and gorgeous hiking trails - you are right in the middle of plenty to do and see while also being tucked away in your own little forest paradise.',

Upon entering the Treehouse you will find the beautiful living space with comfortable seating, wood burning stove, and floor to ceiling windows to take in the views of the ever-changing Colorado landscape.',
